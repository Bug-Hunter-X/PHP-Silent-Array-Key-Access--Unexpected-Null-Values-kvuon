Several approaches can prevent the silent failure of accessing undefined array keys in PHP:

1. **Using `isset()`:** This function checks whether a key exists in an array before accessing it.

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
if (isset($myArray['c'])) {
  $value = $myArray['c'];
  echo $value + 5;
} else {
  echo 'Key does not exist';
}
```

2. **Using `array_key_exists()`:** Similar to `isset()`, this function explicitly checks if a key is present in the array.

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
if (array_key_exists('c', $myArray)) {
  $value = $myArray['c'];
  echo $value + 5;
} else {
  echo 'Key does not exist';
}
```

3. **Null Coalescing Operator (`??`):** This operator provides a concise way to handle potential null values.

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c'] ?? 0; // If 'c' doesn't exist, $value becomes 0
echo $value + 5; // This will output 5
```
By implementing one of these methods, developers can enhance the robustness and predictability of their PHP code, avoiding silent failures caused by undefined array keys.
