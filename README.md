This repository demonstrates a common yet easily overlooked error in PHP: the silent return of null when accessing undefined array keys.  The `bug.php` file showcases the issue where accessing a non-existent key results in a null value without any error message.  This can lead to unexpected behavior and make debugging more challenging. The `bugSolution.php` file offers solutions to mitigate this issue using techniques such as isset(), array_key_exists(), or the null coalescing operator.
