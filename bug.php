In PHP, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with array keys that are not explicitly defined.  If you attempt to access an array element using a key that doesn't exist, instead of receiving a clear error, PHP will silently return null. This can lead to unexpected behavior and difficult-to-debug issues.  For example:

```php
$myArray = ['a' => 1, 'b' => 2];
$value = $myArray['c']; // $value will be null, no error is thrown
echo $value + 5; // This will output 5, not 5 + null
```
This behavior can be problematic as it doesn't immediately signal a problem. The issue becomes more complex in larger applications where the absence of a key might have significant implications.
